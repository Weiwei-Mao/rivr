rivr: An R package for Open Channel Hydraulics
==============================================

This package is designed as an educational tool for students and instructors 
of undergraduate courses in open channel hydraulics. Functions are provided 
for computing flow and channel geometry, normal and critical depths, 
gradually-varied water-surface profiles (e.g. backwater curves) and unsteady 
flow (e.g. flood wave routing).

UPDATE 2/22/2015
----------------

This package is on CRAN now! The binaries should be available soon, but if you
get an error try `install.packages("rivr", type = "source")`.
