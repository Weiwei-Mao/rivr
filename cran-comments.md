Resubmission of rivr 1.2-1. 

Resubmitted again with fixed link in vignettes/publication-reproduction.Rmd,
which I missed the last time. Apologies to the CRAN maintainers for the
repeated submissions.

Resubmitted with fixed links in inst/CITATION, addresses NOTE in
previous submission regarding R-project URLs not in canonical form.

This release recompiles the C++ code in response to updates to package Rcpp.
